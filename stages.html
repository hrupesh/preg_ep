                            <p class="text-align:justify;">In the first trimester, pregnancy is often one of the most confusing
times.  During these first three months or 12 weeks, much of the time
you may not realize that you are pregnant. Once you find out, usually
after the first missed period, you may be left wondering what is
happening to your doctor.  The changes during this part of the pregnancy
are often emotional as well as hormonal, which makes for a wide range
of symptoms to be seen.  Learning about these early pregnancy
symptoms and how to handle them can help you to prepare for what is
to come.</p>
<p class="text-align:justify;">Early pregnancy symptoms will be your first indication that you are
pregnant.  This may include slight bleeding after fertilization, tender and
swollen breasts, increased fatigue and discharge.  Early symptoms of
pregnancy are the body&#39;s way of adjusting to hormonal changes in your
body.  Once the body realizes that it is pregnant, long before you will, it
begins to make adjustments to the body to help take care of the
developing embryo.  Hormones are used to make those changes happen. 
As the body secretes new hormones or changes the levels of other
hormones, you will feel it during these first few weeks.</p>
<p class="text-align:justify;">One of the largest changes that most women face during pregnancy is
morning sickness.  While it is labelled morning sickness, it is important
to know that it can happen at any time during your pregnancy, including
all day long.  For many women, the feeling is nothing more than feeling
nausea.  For others, it is the feeling of having the flu including aches and
chills.  Not all women experience morning sickness.  In fact, many do
not.  What is important to know is that this is a normal body reaction to
the hormones and changes in your body and as a part of the first
trimester of pregnancy, they usually subside after that amount of time.</p>

                            <p class="text-align:center;" class="text-align:justify;"> Many women will want to take an early pregnancy test to find out if they
are in fact pregnant. You can do so with good accuracy when you
purchase a quality testing product.  These tests deduct hormones within
your blood stream, which area also found in your urine.  The test is very
quick and simple and often gives an accurate answer to you question of
am I pregnant.  If you have early symptoms of pregnancy, these tests are
a good first stop for an answer before calling your doctor for a thorough
exam. </p>
<p class="text-align:center;" class="text-align:justify;"> During the first trimester of pregnancy, the body will react in a number
of ways.  You may find yourself temperamental and tired a lot.  You may
find yourself overwhelmed with happiness one minute, but the next
minute you may be worried about the problems that could happen.  The
emotional roller coaster is one that many women go down during these
first few weeks.  It can even be considered one of many early pregnancy
symptoms.</p>
<p class="text-align:center;" class="text-align:justify;"> Weight gain during pregnancy will change throughout.  During the first
trimester pregnancy weight gain is very little, especially at first.  In fact,
for many women, they will lose some weight during the first months due
to a lack of interest in food and to morning sickness. </p>
<p class="text-align:center;" class="text-align:justify;">
With the first trimester pregnancy is often a different for each woman. 
The emotional and physical changes can vary from one person to the
next.  Most importantly, during these first few months, you should take
the time to talk to your doctor and have your first exam.  The first signs
of pregnancy may be faint but by the end of this trimester, you&#39;ll see
incredibly changes already in your body and lifestyle. </p>

                                    <li class="text-align:justify;">  Pregnancy Stages:  What Your Body Will Go Through ,During each of the three pregnancy stages, your body will go through some
changes.  At some times, those changes will be drastic and by the end of
them you may not recognize your body any longer. In other stages of
pregnancy, the changes are small.  In all situations, knowing what to expect
from each stage is an important part of being prepared for your baby.  As
your body changes, it becomes a better home for your child as he or she
develops.</li><br>
<h4>In The First Trimester</h4>
                                    <li class="text-align:justify;">During the first trimester of pregnancy, the changes in the way your body
looks may be minimal but the way that you feel will likely be very
different!  Many of the first signs of pregnancy will happen in small ways
but may have you feeling sick.  For example, you may have nausea which
may become morning sickness.  You may have increased fatigue, which is
cause by the many hormones entering your body.  You may also suffer from
aches and pains, especially in the back.  Your emotions may be across the
board as mood swings are another effect of hormones.  You may also feel

increased stress and anxiety as you wonder and worry about what is to
come.</li><br>
<h4>In The Second Trimester</h4>
                                    <li class="text-align:justify;">In the second trimester, your body will continue to change.  You will find
yourself starting to see pregnancy weight too.  As your baby grows and
expands, you will gain weight.  In most cases, the second trimester is easier
physically than the first.    You may still be suffering from morning sickness,
but it is likely to go away soon.  Your abdomen will begin to expand.  And,
in the sixth month of pregnancy, you are likely to feel your child move for
the first time.  During pregnancy now, you are likely to feel more aches and
pains, especially in the pain, in your abdomen and in the groin and thighs. 
Many women have shortness of breath.  Skin changes during pregnancy
also begin to happen, including stretch marks.</li><br>
<h4>In The Third Trimester</h4>
<li class="text-align:justify;">In the third trimester, pregnancy stages will come to life.  Now, you will see
the most growth of your abdomen as the child really grows and pushes into
your abdomen wall and your back.  You may find it more difficult to breath
now.  Plus, as baby moves around, he may push on your organs, which may
cause tenderness and pain throughout your body.  You may experience
heartburn in this stage of pregnancy.  You may also see noticeable
difference in your ankles and feet including swelling which is caused by the
increase of weight.  Additional signs of third trimester including
haemorrhoids, difficulty sleeping well at night, and tender and swollen
breasts.</li>
<li class="text-align:justify;">It is important to note that in all pregnancy stages, your body will react
specifically to you.  In other words, you may experience many of these
symptoms of pregnancy or no symptoms of pregnancy.   You may find
yourself feeling much different.  Unless you find yourself facing painful
situations, or you are unable to cope with certain conditions, you are likely
having a healthy pregnancy.  Report any changes in the way that you feel to
your doctor.</li>
<li class="text-align:justify;">The changes in your body are natural, in most cases. While they may sound
painful or uncomfortable, they are nearly always a signal of your child&#39;s
upcoming birth.  From the first signs of pregnancy until your final stage of

pregnancy, your body will conform to the needs of your growing child. 
With a healthy pregnancy diet, good exercise and sleep, your baby will have
the best chance are a healthy birth.  Talk to your doctor about changes you
are unsure about.</li>

                            <p class="text-align:justify;"> Pregnancy Week By Week Changes In Baby,In pregnancy week by week changes will happen with your baby.  In fact,
many times babies will change, grow and develop day to day.  As a new
mother or father, you may want to know what is happening with your child
at any stage of pregnancy.  While there is some difference between each
pregnancy, most pregnancies follow the same developmental stages.  You
can know what changes your baby is having.  Take a look at the changes in
baby over these pregnancy changes.</p><br>
<h4>First Trimester Changes</h4>
<p class="text-align:justify;">First trimester changes during pregnancy will be the smallest in terms of
mom, but they are significant for baby&#39;s development.  During the first
weeks of pregnancy, the fertilized egg will implant into the uterus and will
begin to develop a placenta.  From this point, cells multiple at an incredible
pace as your baby begins to develop.  By the end of the first trimester, the
baby will be about three inches long.  They weigh just about an ounce at
this point.  In the first three months of pregnancy, your baby has ears and
eyes moving into position as well as a liver that is making bile.  The kidneys
are growing and secreting the baby&#39;s first urine.</p><br>
<h4>Second Trimester Changes</h4>
<p class="text-align:justify;">A look at the pregnancy week by week in the second trimester will allow
you to see a lot of growth in your baby, including the fact that you will
actually feel your child move towards the end of this trimester.  By the end
of this trimester, your baby will weigh just less than two pounds.  He or she
will be about 13 inches in length.  A closer look at pregnancy in the second
trimester will reveal that the baby has developed fingers and toes as well as
eyelashes and eyebrows.  With an ultrasound now, you are likely to see
your baby&#39;s formation clearly.  Most babies begin to move in the fifth
month too, so you may feel this happen surprisingly.  Plus, by the time this
trimester is over, your child will have all of his organs in place and working including the lungs, heart and kidneys, though they can&#39;t sustain him fully
just yet.</p><br>
<h4>Third Trimester Changes</h4>
<p class="text-align:justify;">A closely look at pregnancy week by week in this trimester will show the
child really becoming defined.  The baby is moving and growing now. 
Your pregnancy weight gain is likely the highest here.  Weight gain during
pregnancy will depend on your body, but as your child really grows now, he
or she will move readily.  Your baby continues to grow and pushes at the
abdomen.  The baby is able to open eyes now and may even suck his
thumb.  Baby will also turn during the third trimester of pregnancy to
ready itself for birth.  The baby is likely to be about 20 to 22 inches in
length at the time of birth, on average, and weigh about seven to eight
pounds on average.</p><br>
<p class="text-align:justify;">Pregnancy stages will differ from one person to another.  With a proper
pregnancy diet and pregnancy exercise, you will give your baby all he
needs to develop correctly.  Through ultrasounds and careful monitoring of
your health, your doctor will work to know what&#39; sharpening with baby in
pregnancy.  What&#39;s more, your doctor is likely to give you all the
information that you ask for, so ask questions about pregnancy at each visit
so that you know what is happening with the development of baby.  With a
look at pregnancy week by week, you will see an incredible development
happening.  This amazing look is one that even doctors marvel at from time
to time.  Your baby&#39;s development makes pregnancy enjoyable.</p><br>
